# Dev-ResNet

![Alt Text](https://github.com/EmbryoPhenomics/dev-resnet/blob/main/assets/model_schematic.png)

A novel network for automating the detection of developmental events, specifically applied here to embryonic stages of the aquatic snail, *Lymnaea stagnalis*. We supply training, evaluation and inference code so that others can extend and apply this model to a species of their choosing. 

**Inference example of Dev-ResNet**

This is an example showcase of Dev-ResNet and it's capabilities for detecting developmental events, shown here for the entire embryonic development of the great pond snail, *Lymnaea stagnalis*.

Note to achieve these results, Dev-ResNet was trained on the following dataset: https://zenodo.org/record/8214975.
